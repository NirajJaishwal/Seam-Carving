# Seam Carving Image Resizing with Dynamic Programming

## Description
This project implements a dynamic programming algorithm called seam carving for image resizing. Seam carving changes the size of an image by removing the least visible pixels using an energy function. The implementation is done in Python.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:

## Usage
1. Open the provided Jupyter notebook `Seam_carving.jpynb`.
2. Run the notebook and follow the instructions in the first cell to provide the image file name and specify the number of vertical seams and horizontal seam to be removed.
3. Execute the notebook to resize the image and save the processed image.
4. The processed image will be saved as `original_image_file_name_processed_v_h.pgm` in the same directory. `v` represent the number of vetical seam and `h` represent the number of horizontal seam
